The Clubhouse clone but on Android

Clubhouse is an invitation-only social network for iOS that facilitates audio based communication through groups that are called rooms, which can hold up to 5,000 people.

I was inspired by this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/RussellOkung/status/1364674999349567494?s=20) by Franck Ndame who cloned the app in Swift UI. Soon after I've seen many clones but all of them are made for iOS, I have yet to see one for Android, so I decided to do it myself.

With the beta release of Jetpack Compose and the team over at Clubhouse have yet to release the app for Android, I've decided to try and show what Clubhouse would look like on Android.

I will be focusing on trying to recreate the UI using Franck's [Figma assets](https://www.figma.com/file/8DwfJi51F88IW1xNVrDMP4/Clubapartment?node-id=0%3A1) in Jetpack Compose and not any backend functionality.
